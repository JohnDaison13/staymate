StayMate is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb that allows users to rent out properties or find places to stay. Users can register, list their properties with relevant details, browse listings, and make bookings. The project demonstrates core CRUD functionalities with user authentication and data management using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
